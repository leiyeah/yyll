      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. It is an open-source project for automating the deployment of applications as portable, self-sufficient containers that can run on the cloud or on-premises. Docker is also a company that promotes and evolves this technology. Docker works in collaboration with cloud, Linux, and Windows vendors, including Microsoft. </p>

      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      <p>In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination. In another word, a virtual machine (VM) is an operating system (OS) or application environment that is installed on software, which imitates dedicated hardware. The end user has the same experience on a virtual machine as they would have on dedicated hardware.</p>
